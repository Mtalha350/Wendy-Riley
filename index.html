        I experienced exceptional service with my insurance representative,
        Wendy Riley. She understood my insurance needs, and clearly explained
        the details of my policy and answered all my questions. Wendy is very
        knowledgeable and professional, and at the same time, very friendly and
        easy to talk to. I would recommend Wendy to any of my friends looking
        for insurance advice.
